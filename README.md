# PeopleCode Utilities for Dynamic Record Queries

This repository provides reusable PeopleCode methods for counting and fetching rows from PeopleSoft records using dynamic filters, ordering, and field selection. Originally developed for internal use, the code has been refactored for public PeopleSoft deployment to assist developers in building flexible and maintainable App Classes.

## Features

- Dynamic SQL generation for record queries
- Count records with flexible filter conditions
- Fetch rows with ordering and field selection
- Designed for extensibility and reuse in App Classes

## Installation

Simply copy the provided App Class methods into your PeopleSoft project. Import your class properly. No external dependencies required.

Special thanks to ##Griffith University## the ideas and actions behind this code were shaped while working on various solutions for Griffith. As a contribution to the broader PeopleSoft community, this work is made publicly available for free use and improvement. We hope it supports and inspires others working in similar domains.
